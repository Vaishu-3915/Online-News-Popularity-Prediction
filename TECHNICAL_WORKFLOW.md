# Online News Popularity Analysis - Technical Workflow Documentation

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for predicting online news article popularity using multiple algorithms implemented from scratch. The system processes news article metadata and classifies articles as "popular" or "not popular" based on social media shares.

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Architecture
**Decision**: Split monolithic Jupyter notebook into focused modules
**Rationale**: 
- Better maintainability and code organization
- Easier testing and debugging
- Reusable components
- Professional software development practices

**Modules Created**:
- `preprocessing.py` - Data cleaning and feature engineering
- `models.py` - Machine learning algorithm implementations
- `evaluation.py` - Model evaluation and visualization
- `model_persistence.py` - Save/load trained models
- `cross_validation.py` - Robust model evaluation
- `report_generator.py` - Professional report generation
- `dashboard.py` - Interactive web interface
- `main.py` - Orchestration script

### 2. Algorithm Selection & Implementation

#### Logistic Regression (From Scratch)
**Implementation**: Custom gradient descent with sigmoid activation
**Key Features**:
- Manual feature scaling for continuous variables
- Bias term addition for intercept
- Gradient clipping to prevent overflow
- Convergence monitoring with epsilon threshold

```python
def sigmoid(self, z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-np.clip(z, -500, 500)))  # Clipping prevents overflow

def gradient_descent(self, X, y):
    # Custom implementation with convergence monitoring
    for iteration in range(self.max_iteration):
        self.w -= self.learning_rate * self.cost_derivative(X, y)
        if abs(prev_error - curr_error) < self.epsilon:
            break
```

**Why Custom Implementation**: Demonstrates understanding of underlying mathematics and optimization

#### Naive Bayes (From Scratch)
**Implementation**: Hybrid approach handling both continuous and categorical features
**Key Features**:
- Gaussian distribution for continuous features
- Laplace smoothing for categorical features
- Separate likelihood calculations
- Posterior probability computation

```python
def extract_features(self, data):
    # Intelligent separation of continuous vs categorical
    for col in data.columns:
        if data[col].nunique() <= 2:  # One-hot encoded
            X_cat.append(data[col])
        else:  # Continuous
            X_cont.append(data[col])
```

**Design Decision**: Handle mixed data types appropriately rather than forcing all features into one distribution type

#### Neural Network (PyTorch)
**Implementation**: Feedforward network with custom architecture
**Key Features**:
- Configurable hidden layers
- ReLU activation for hidden layers
- Sigmoid output for binary classification
- Custom metrics calculation

**Why PyTorch**: Demonstrates familiarity with modern deep learning frameworks

**Key Features**:
- Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm
- Linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels
- Proper dual optimization
- Bias term handling

### 3. Data Preprocessing Pipeline

#### Feature Engineering Strategy
**Original Features**: 61 columns including URL, timedelta, content features
**Processed Features**: 27 columns after cleaning and engineering

**Key Transformations**:
1. **Column Cleaning**: Remove spaces, drop irrelevant columns (URL, timedelta)
2. **Categorical Encoding**: Convert weekday columns to single ordinal feature
3. **Target Creation**: Binary classification based on 1400 shares threshold
4. **Correlation Removal**: Drop highly correlated features (>0.7 threshold)
5. **Log Transformation**: Apply to skewed numeric features
6. **Feature Engineering**: Create interaction and spread features
7. **Statistical Selection**: Kruskal-Wallis test for feature significance

#### Feature Engineering Examples
```python
# Create spread features
df['kw_min_max_spread'] = df['kw_min_max'] - df['kw_min_min']

# Create interaction features  
df['average_token_length_times_num_keywords'] = df['average_token_length'] * df['num_keywords']

# Create average features
df['average_positive_polarity'] = (df['min_positive_polarity'] + df['max_positive_polarity']) / 2
```

**Rationale**: Domain knowledge-driven feature creation to capture article characteristics that might predict popularity

### 4. Model Evaluation Strategy

#### Metrics Selection
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness
- **Precision**: Minimize false positives
- **Recall**: Minimize false negatives  
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean for balanced evaluation

#### Cross-Validation Implementation
**Decision**: Implement custom cross-validation rather than using sklearn
**Rationale**: 
- Demonstrates understanding of CV principles
- Handles custom model interfaces
- Provides detailed fold-by-fold analysis

```python
def evaluate_logistic_regression(self, df):
    skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=self.cv_folds, shuffle=True, random_state=self.random_state)
    
    for train_idx, val_idx in skf.split(X, y):
        # Custom model training and evaluation
        model = LogisticRegression(train_df, val_df)
        model.fit()
        metrics = calculate_metrics(y_val, y_pred)
```

### 5. Advanced Features Implementation

#### Model Persistence
**Problem**: Avoid retraining models repeatedly
**Solution**: Custom serialization system with metadata
**Features**:
- Timestamp-based versioning
- Model metadata storage
- Easy loading and prediction
- Cross-platform compatibility

```python
def save_model(self, model, model_name, metadata=None):
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
    save_data = {
        'model': model,
        'metadata': metadata,
        'timestamp': timestamp
    }
    # Pickle serialization with JSON metadata
```

        class Module: pass
```
