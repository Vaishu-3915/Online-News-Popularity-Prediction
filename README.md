This project aims to analyze a dataset of online news articles and develop a classification model to predict their popularity based on various input features. The dataset includes traits and 
characteristics of the articles, and through the utilization of machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and logistic regression, predictive models are 
constructed from scratch by using only NumPy and Pandas. The objective is to provide insights into the factors that influence article popularity, enabling informed decision-making and content 
optimization strategies. By employing advanced statistical methods, this study seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of online content dynamics.
